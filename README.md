# Unexpected Null Value Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to unexpected null value handling. The `foo` function does not explicitly handle null values passed as arguments, leading to silent exits and potentially incorrect results.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function contains a conditional check for null values (`if (a === null || b === null) { return; }`). While this seems like error handling, it silently exits the function without any indication that null values were encountered. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and make debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling null values by either: 
1. Throwing an error to signal invalid input. 
2. Providing default values or alternative logic to handle null gracefully.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a more robust approach to handling null values, which provides better error handling and makes the function's behavior more predictable.
